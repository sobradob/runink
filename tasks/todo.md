# RunInk — TODO

## Bugs

- [ ] **PNG export horizontal lines + UI/export mismatch**
  - What user sees in the UI preview doesn't match the exported PNG
  - Partially addressed (dynamic WebGL texture detection, disabled tile fade, double-idle wait)
  - Needs real-world testing to confirm banding is resolved
  - File: `src/features/poster/infrastructure/renderer/index.ts`

## UX Improvements

- [ ] **Improve checkout process with poster preview**
  - Show a preview of the poster in the Order Print modal before payment
  - Currently the user clicks "Order Print", selects a tier, and immediately goes to Stripe — no visual confirmation of what they're buying
  - Consider rendering a thumbnail preview in the tier selection modal
  - Note: Order Print currently gated behind "Coming Soon" popup (`COMING_SOON` flag in OrderButton.tsx)

## Infrastructure

- [ ] End-to-end test of full purchase flow (Stripe test mode → shipping → Gelato)
- [ ] Verify domain on Resend, switch `EMAIL_FROM` to `orders@runink.app`
- [ ] Gelato webhook integration (auto-update order status on print/ship/deliver)

## Completed

- [x] Upload URL routing fix
- [x] Express 5 wildcard param fix
