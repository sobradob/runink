# RunInk — TODO

## Bugs

- [x] **PNG export doesn't match preview** — Fixed: use pixelRatio scaling instead of container resize
- [x] **Strava OAuth redirects to `ondigitalocean.app` instead of `runink.app`** — Fixed: component-level env var on DO was overriding the correct app-level value. Deleted the component-level var.

## UX Improvements

- [ ] **Unify size selector and print tier selector**
  - Currently two separate size pickers: one in the editor (30x40cm, 40x60cm, etc.) and one in the checkout (Small Poster, Large Poster, etc.)
  - Confusing UX — selecting a print tier should auto-set the poster dimensions, or the editor size should determine which tiers are available
  - Consider: remove the size picker from the editor when ordering a print, and let the tier selection drive dimensions

- [ ] **Improve checkout process with poster preview**
  - Show a preview of the poster in the Order Print modal before payment
  - Currently the user clicks "Order Print", selects a tier, and immediately goes to Stripe — no visual confirmation of what they're buying
  - Consider rendering a thumbnail preview in the tier selection modal

## Infrastructure

- [ ] End-to-end test of full purchase flow (Stripe test mode → shipping → Gelato)
- [ ] Verify domain on Resend, switch `EMAIL_FROM` to `orders@runink.app`
- [ ] Gelato webhook integration (auto-update order status on print/ship/deliver)
